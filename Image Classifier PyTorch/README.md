# AI Programming with Python Project

This project is part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. It includes code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, which is later converted into a command line application.

## Project Structure

### 1. cat_to_name.json

This file contains a mapping of flower categories to their names.

```json
{"21": "fire lily", "3": "canterbury bells", ...}
```

### 2. predict.py

This script is used for making predictions with the trained model.

#### Usage:

```bash
python predict.py flowers/test/1/image_06743.jpg --model alexnet
```

### 3. train.py

This script is used for training the image classifier.

#### Usage:

```bash
# Train with default model (vgg11)
python train.py flowers

# Train with a specific model (e.g., alexnet)
python train.py flowers --model alexnet
```

### 4. utils.py

This file contains utility functions used in both `predict.py` and `train.py`. It includes data loading and transformations.

### 5. workspace-utils.py

This file provides utility functions for keeping the Udacity workspace active during training. It helps prevent the workspace from going idle.

## Usage Notes

- The `predict.py` script should be used with the `--model alexnet` argument when using the provided checkpoint trained on alexnet. For VGG, a separate checkpoint should be created.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed for your specific use case. Happy coding!
